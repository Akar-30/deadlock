        <h1>Welcome to Deadlock Detection and Recovery</h1>
        <p>
            This application implements Deadlock Detection and Recovery using Banker's Algorithm.
            Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by
            simulating
            the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an "s-state" check
            to
            test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm works by maintaining a set of data structures to keep track of the resources allocated to each
            process,
            the maximum resources each process may need, and the resources currently available. It then uses these data
            structures
            to determine if the system is in a safe state, meaning that there is a sequence of processes that can be
            completed
            without causing a deadlock.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the system is in a safe state, the resources can be allocated to the processes. If not, the system must
            wait until
            enough resources are available to ensure that the system remains in a safe state. This helps in preventing
            deadlocks
            by ensuring that resources are allocated in a way that avoids circular wait conditions.
