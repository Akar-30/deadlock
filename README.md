# Deadlock Detection and Recovery using Banker's Algorithm

## Introduction

This project implements Deadlock Detection and Recovery using Banker's Algorithm. Deadlocks are a significant issue in concurrent systems where multiple processes compete for limited resources. This project aims to address this problem by implementing a system that can detect and recover from deadlocks using Banker's Algorithm.

## Objectives

1. Implement a web-based application that simulates the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock detection and recovery.
2. Allow users to input the number of resource types, the maximum resource needs, and the current allocation for each process.
3. Determine if the system is in a safe state and provide a safe sequence# Deadlock Detection and Recovery using Banker's Algorithm
